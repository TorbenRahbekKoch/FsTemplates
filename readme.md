# Routing and Templating with F#

This is a playground for me to work with some ideas I have about html templates
and url-routing. And to obtain some skills using F#.

It is - for now - just implementing a simple todo-list, thanks to [TodoMvc](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc)
for the todo-part of the code.
